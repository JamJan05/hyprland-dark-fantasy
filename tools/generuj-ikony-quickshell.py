// THE PRAGMA MUST COME BEFORE THE COMMENT, NOT AFTER IT.
//
// The Quickshell scanner (src/core/scan.cpp) reads the file header line by
// line and stops at the FIRST line containing an opening brace -
// without stripping comments first. A brace in a descriptive comment
// therefore closes the header before the scanner reaches "pragma Singleton",
// and the file registers as a regular type instead of a singleton.
//
// Keeping the pragma on the first line makes the file immune to comment contents.

//  THIS FILE IS GENERATED, not rewritten by hand. The code points

//  the same speaker and the same power profile look identical on the bar
//  and in the panel, not "almost the same".
//
//  Writing "\\u{{f057e}}" instead of a pasted character is deliberate: glyphs
