# Keybindings

[← README](../README.md) · [Polski](pl/keybindings.md)

Every binding is defined in `config/hypr/hyprland.lua` with a description. The same list, straight from the compositor, is in Cogwheel → Hyprland → Shortcuts.

## Shell and apps

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER + R` | Tile menu (pause), opened on Arsenal |
| `SUPER + U` | Cogwheel (settings) |
| `SUPER + O` | Media player panel |
| `SUPER + B` | Next power profile |
| `SUPER + Q` | Terminal (kitty) |
| `SUPER + W` | File manager (yazi) |
| `SUPER + SHIFT + V` | Clipboard history (rofi) |
| `SUPER + L` | Lock screen |
| `SUPER + M` | Log out |

`SUPER + R`, `U`, `O` and `B` reach the shell through global shortcuts (`quickshell:menuToggle`, `systemToggle`, `mediaToggle`, `profilZasilania`). If the shell is not running they do nothing. `hyprctl globalshortcuts` lists what is registered.
