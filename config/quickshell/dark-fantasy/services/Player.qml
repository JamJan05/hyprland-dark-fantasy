pragma Singleton

// THE PRAGMA MUST COME BEFORE THE COMMENT, NOT AFTER IT.
// Quickshell's scanner stops reading the header at the first line
// containing "{", without stripping comments first - a brace
// in a comment would disable singleton registration. Details
// in services/Brightness.qml.

//  PLAYER - A SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH ABOUT WHAT IS PLAYING.
//
//  MediaPanel and future bar elements read the state FROM HERE, just
//  as the volume comes from Audio.qml. There is no playerctl here and nothing
//  is polled - Quickshell.Services.Mpris listens on D-Bus
//  and reports changes by itself.
//
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------
//  WHICH PLAYER TO SHOW
//
//  Spotify is not the only one. In practice several run in the background at once: Spotify,
//  a YouTube tab in Firefox and mpv. Selection policy, in order:
//
//    1. the one that is CURRENTLY PLAYING;
//    2. if several are playing - the one that started playing last;
//    3. if none is playing - the last one that played (as long as it still
//       exists), so that the panel does not jump to a random program
//       the moment you pause;
//    4. any paused one;
//    5. whichever comes first.
//
//  Points 2 and 3 require remembering who played last. This is done by
//  the Instantiator below: it attaches one observer to each
//  player and records its identifier at the moment it
//  starts playing. Without this there would be nothing to determine "most recently active"
//  with - the list from Mpris.players has no defined order.
