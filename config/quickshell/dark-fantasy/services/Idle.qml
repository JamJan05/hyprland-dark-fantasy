// THE PRAGMA MUST COME BEFORE THE COMMENT, NOT AFTER IT.

//  IDLE INHIBITOR - ONE OWNER, TWO VIEWS.
//
//  Keeps hypridle from doing what it does after inactivity:
//      300 s  - turns the screen off (DPMS off)
//      600 s  - locks the session
//      1800 s - suspends the computer
//
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------
//  WHY NOT "SYNCHRONIZATION" WITH WAYBAR
//
//  Waybar's built-in "idle_inhibitor" module holds the inhibitor ITSELF, via
//  the idle-inhibit protocol. It can be neither read nor set
//  from outside - it is internal to the bar.
//
//  If the panel held a second inhibitor next to that one, there would be TWO
//  independent ones: you turn it off in the panel, and the screen still does not turn off, because the bar
//  holds its own. Two states that cannot be reconciled.
//
//  That is why only Quickshell holds the inhibitor. The toggle is
//  in the Cogwheel (System -> Behavior), and scripts are left with
//  "qs ipc call idle toggle".
//
//  Until the Dark Souls-style rebuild, the bar had a "custom/idle" module -
//  a view of this inhibitor, woken by the SIGRTMIN+8 signal on every change.
//  The module left the bar, and the signal went with it.
