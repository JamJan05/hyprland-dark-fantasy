# Hyprland Dark Fantasy

A complete Hyprland desktop for Gentoo Linux that borrows the feel of the Dark Souls 3 menus through shapes, palette and typography alone.

**English** · [Polski](README.pl.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| ![Arsenal](assets/zrzuty/arsenal.jpg) | ![Cogwheel](assets/zrzuty/cogwheel.jpg) |
| **Arsenal**: every installed program, with an item-style description | **Cogwheel**: settings laid out like in-game options |
| ![Bonfire](assets/zrzuty/bonfire.jpg) | ![Media panel](assets/zrzuty/media.jpg) |
| **Bonfire**: lock, suspend, log out, restart, shut down | **Media panel**: the current player, from the bar or `SUPER + O` |
| ![Tidings](assets/zrzuty/tidings.jpg) | |
| **Tidings**: notification history and "do not disturb" | |

## Features

- **Hyprland configured in Lua** (`hyprland.lua`, the `hl.*` API), not the `.conf` format that Hyprland 0.57 removes.
- **HUD in the top-left corner**: the floor emblem, HP / FP / stamina bars for battery, memory and CPU, the floor's desktops, and warnings that only appear when network traffic or CPU temperature is high.
- **A row of six tiles** instead of a dock and an app menu: Arsenal (apps), Satchel (files), Status (btop), Tidings (notifications), Cogwheel (settings), Bonfire (session). The row hides while windows are open and comes back when the cursor touches the bottom edge.
- **A pause menu you can drive from the keyboard**: press `SUPER + R` and start typing a program name. Arrows, Enter and Esc work in every tile.
- **Floors**: up to ten floors of desktops, each with its own desktops 1-0, plus three-finger gestures.
- **Live settings** in the Cogwheel: sound, brightness, power profile, battery charge limit, network, Bluetooth, gaps, blur, animation speed, wallpaper, keyboard layout, monitor scale, floors.
- **A "now" frame on Waybar** with the clock, the date and the current track. The player zone appears only while some application is playing.
- **Quickshell handles notifications, the OSD and the media panel**, so there is no separate daemon.
- **The same look everywhere**: hyprlock, an SDDM login theme, GTK 3/4, kitty, yazi, btop and the rofi clipboard picker.
- **English or Polish**, switched instantly.
- **Installers that show a plan first**: a copying installer that keeps your local changes and backs up the rest, and a from-scratch Gentoo bootstrap.

The design is original. The repository contains no assets, images, fonts or texts from Dark Souls or any other game.

## Quick start

These commands install the configuration. The packages have to be installed already (see [Requirements](#requirements)).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JamJan05/Hyprland-Dark-Fantasy.git ~/hyprland-dark-fantasy
cd ~/hyprland-dark-fantasy
./install.sh            # dry run: prints what would be copied, changes nothing
./install.sh --apply    # copies config/ into ~/.config, backs up files you changed
hyprctl reload          # or log out and start a Hyprland session
```

After `--apply` the files in `~/.config` are copies, so the repository folder can be deleted. To change something later, clone it again, edit, run `./install.sh --apply` and delete the folder again. Your local edits in `~/.config` survive a reinstall unless the same file changed in the repo; see [installation.md](docs/installation.md#what-installsh-copies). The installer also prints the steps that need root: Portage files, the SDDM theme and the udev rule.

> [!NOTE]
> The default keyboard layout is `pl`. Change it in Cogwheel → Hyprland → Input → Keyboard layout, or in `kb_layout` in `config/hypr/hyprland.lua`.

**Installing Gentoo from scratch?** [`bootstrap.sh`](bootstrap.sh) enables the overlays, installs the packages, clones the repository and runs `install.sh --apply`. It also shows a plan first. See [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md).

## Requirements

- **Gentoo Linux** with the **GURU** and **hyproverlay** overlays. The package files are in `gentoo/`. The configuration was built on OpenRC + elogind; the Gentoo-specific parts are listed in [docs/hardware.md](docs/hardware.md).
- **Hyprland 0.56+** with the Lua config, **Quickshell** (tested with 0.3.1), **Waybar** with USE `backlight network wifi mpris tray pipewire pulseaudio upower`.
- hyprlock, hypridle, hyprpaper (0.8 syntax), hyprshot, wl-clipboard + cliphist, rofi-wayland, hyprpolkitagent, xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland.
- PipeWire + WirePlumber, playerctl, brightnessctl, power-profiles-daemon and BlueZ. The network section relies on NetworkManager and the battery readout on UPower.
- kitty, yazi, btop, tty-clock, jq, Pillow (`dev-python/pillow`).
- Fonts: **EB Garamond** and **JetBrainsMono Nerd Font** (`media-fonts/nerdfonts` with USE `jetbrainsmono`).
- Theme: **adw-gtk3**, **Papirus-Dark** icons, **Bibata-Original-Classic** cursor.

Copy `gentoo/package.accept_keywords/hyprland-desktop` and `gentoo/package.use/hyprland-desktop` into `/etc/portage/` first. SDDM is not in the list; install it yourself if you want the login theme.

| `SUPER + R` | Tile menu, opened on Arsenal (type to search) |
| `SUPER + U` | Cogwheel (settings) |
| `SUPER + O` | Media panel |
| `SUPER + Q` | Terminal (kitty) |
| `SUPER + W` | File manager (yazi) |
| `SUPER + C` | Close window |

The full list is in [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md), or open Cogwheel → Hyprland → Shortcuts to see it with descriptions.

## Language

The interface is in **English** by default. You can switch to **Polish** in **Cogwheel → System → Language**. The change is instant, and Waybar, the lock screen and the shortcut descriptions follow it. The SDDM login theme has its own language setting: `sddm/install-theme.sh --apply --lang pl`. Details are in [docs/cogwheel.md](docs/cogwheel.md#language).
